- Super User
- General Administrator
- Unit Group Administrator
- Unit Administrator
- Unit Manager
- Unit Viewer
- Reserver i.e. End User


Administration Workflow Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is an example that should help understanding the user roles.

1. Super User (in Django Admin)

   * creates a new Unit Group.

     - Unit Group could be e.g. "Helsinki Libraries" or "Espoo Youth
       Centers"

   * authorizes an user as Unit Group Administrator for the Unit Group.

     - Note: The authorized user should have already logged in to
       Varaamo (or tried to log in to Respa Admin at least once) so that
       the User account exists in the database.

2. Unit Group Administrator (in Respa Admin)

   * creates new Units to the Unit Group.

   * authorizes some users as Unit Administrators for the new units.

3. Unit Administrator (in Respa Admin)

   * authorizes some users as Unit Managers for the unit.

   * grants some users to approve reservations in the unit.

   * creates new Resources to the Unit.

4. Unit Manager (in Respa Admin)

   * updates the details of the Resources in the Unit.

5. Unit Viewer

   * examines and modifies end users reservations on request

6. User with the permission granted in step 3 (in Varaamo)

   * approves reservations.


Permissions
-----------

Super User Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Super Users implicitly have all possible permissions.**

There is some functionality that is only available to the Super Users.
Access to these actions is not implemented via Django Permissions, but
they are still listed here to make it clear that these actions are only
available for the Super Users.  These actions can be performed in the
Django Admin interface.

super
    Can make any changes in Django Admin

can_manage_unit_groups
    Can manage Unit Groups, i.e. create/delete Unit Groups,
    assign/unassign Units to/from Unit Groups, and authorize/unauthorize
    users as Unit Group Administrators.

can_change_unit_of_resource
    Can change the Unit of a Resource (i.e. move the Resource to another
    Unit)

can_manage_all_reservations
    Can display/modify/delete any reservation

Resource Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The resource permissions can be granted individually to any user or user
group on two scopes:

  * Resource Group: The permission is granted to all resources in the
    resource group.
  * Unit: The permission is granted to all resources of the unit.

The explicit resource permissions are implemented with Django Guardian.
All resource permissions are defined in ``resources/models/permissions.py``.


In addition following user roles has resource permissions in Respa:

  * General Administrators (GA)
  * Unit Group Administrator (UGA)
  * Unit Administrators (UA)
  * Unit Manager (UM)
  * Unit Viewer (UV)

These roles implicitly has certain permissions for the resources in
the Unit Group or Unit. All role based permissions are represented in
table below.

Respa Admin Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Respa Admin permissions are granted to the Unit Group Administrators
(UGA), Unit Administrators (UA), Unit Managers (UM), Unit Viewers (UV) and General
Administrators (GA).  Most of them are granted per Unit Group or per
Unit basis, but there are also a few general permissions which are not
tied to any object.  The permissions are listed in the following table
with the scope of authorization and the authorized roles.

General Administrator role is not bound to any Unit or Unit Group and so
their permissions are unscoped.

Implementation of the Roles
---------------------------

Staff Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All users having any of these Super User, Administrator or Manager
statuses are considered "staff" and should have the ``is_staff``
property of the User object set to True.

Super User
~~~~~~~~~~

Super User status is granted by setting the ``is_superuser`` property of
the User object to True.

General Administrator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General Administrator status is granted by setting ``is_general_admin``
property of the User object to True.

Unit Group Administrator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unit Group Administrator status is given per Unit Group via an
``UnitGroupAuthorization`` link.  The authorizations of an unit group
called ``unit_group`` can be queried like this::

    >>> unit_group.authorizations.all()
    <QuerySet [
        UnitGroupAuthorization(
            authorized=user1,
            subject=unit_group1,
            level=UnitGroupAuthorizationLevel.admin),
        UnitGroupAuthorization(
            authorized=user2,
            subject=unit_group1,
            level=UnitGroupAuthorizationLevel.admin),
        ...
    ]>

Unit Administrators, Managers and Viewers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unit Administrator, Unit Manager and Unit Viewer status is given per Unit via an
``UnitAuthorization`` link.  The authorizations of an unit called
``unit`` can be queried like this::

    >>> unit.authorizations.all()
    <QuerySet [
        UnitAuthorization(
            authorized=user1,
            subject=unit1,
            level=UnitAuthorizationLevel.admin),
        UnitAuthorization(
            authorized=user2,
            subject=unit1,
            level=UnitAuthorizationLevel.manager),
        UnitAuthorization(
            authorized=user3,
            subject=unit1,
            level=UnitAuthorizationLevel.viewer),
        ...
    ]>
